## The story

I've tried many ways to increase the balance of my crypto portfolio without too much risk for quite some time now, i've used numerous trading bots, algorithms and premium signal services... and in the end I was always on the losing side.
Eventually I thought of a simple mechanism myself, inspired by HODL (Hold On For Dear Life).

The idea is pretty simple, and you should only be asking yourself one question:
Which cryptocurrencies do I believe in for the long term, which cryptocurrencies are or would be in my HODL portfolio anyway, regardless of the market’s state? Those cryptocurrencies are the ones you should be trading with HODLv2.

You should only configure your bot with cryptocurrencies you believe in, because then you don’t mind holding this cryptocurrency in your portfolio if the market turns bearish (for a longer period of time).
HODLing trades in loss would be exactly the same as directly adding it to your HODL portfolio and wait for the price to rise again, but then without the possibility to increase its value. Therefore, we do not use stoploss to accept losses, instead we embrace the bear market and wait for the bot to sell in profit when it can.
